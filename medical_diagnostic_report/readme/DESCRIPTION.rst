This addon enables to create medical diagnostic reports with a lot of flexibility.

The reports are created from report templates which can be configured with several options, as for example, adding observations, composition, conclusions... It also ensures that the report has not been modified through a digest process.

The observations can be created with a concept or without. Is it recommended to do it with a concept, specially if it's an observation that you want to keep track.
From the patient view you can see a concept evolution through a wizard in a graph and a pivot report in Medical -> Report -> Observations.

This model medical.observation is done in such a way the they can be created from a report or not in order to do it more scalable.
